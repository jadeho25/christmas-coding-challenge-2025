LeetCode question 577. Employee Bonus
Write a solution to report the name and bonus amount of each employee who satisfies either of the following:
The employee has a bonus less than 1000.
The employee did not get any bonus.
Return the result table in any order.

Answer:
SELECT e.name, b.bonus
FROM Employee e
LEFT JOIN Bonus b
ON e.empId = b.empId
WHERE b.bonus < 1000 OR b.bonus is null

Also learnt new concepts about handling null values:
-- 1. Coalesce
It's like "If" condition, but for Null values
Must be the same data types

Example 1 coalesce(web_address, store_name)
^this is to select store_name if web_address is Null. 

Example 2coalesce(web_address, store_name, store_id)
^this is an error because store_id is a numeric data type. All of the expressions should be of the same data type.

-- 2. NVL
replace null values from an expression with a specified string

Example 1 nvl(comm,0)
^this is to replace the null values in the field of "comm" with 0

Example 2 nvl(comm, 'no commission')
^this is an error because the field "comm" only takes numeric data type.
