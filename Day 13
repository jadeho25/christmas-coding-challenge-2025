LeetCode question 610. Triangle Judgement
In SQL, (x, y, z) is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains the lengths of three line segments.
Report for every three line segments whether they can form a triangle.

Answer:
SELECT 
x, 
y, 
z,
CASE
    WHEN x + y > z
    AND x + z > y
    AND y + z > x
    THEN 'Yes'
    ELSE 'No'
END AS triangle
FROM Triangle;


Learning note from ChatGPT:
The concept of 'CASE'
Think of CASE like if / else in programming.

Syntax:
CASE
    WHEN condition THEN value_if_true
    ELSE value_if_false
END

Example:
SELECT
    x,
    CASE
        WHEN x > 10 THEN 'Big'
        ELSE 'Small'
    END AS size
FROM Triangle;

^ this is row-by-row logic; 
For each row:
If x > 10 → output "Big"
Otherwise → output "Small"

^ this is also related to the concept of '(x, y, z) is the primary key column for this table'.


My initial question: "How do I create an output column with a boolean value and column name 'triangle' when that's not a column in the table."
^ the concept of 'CASE' answers this.
