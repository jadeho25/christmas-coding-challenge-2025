Leetcode Question 197. Rising Temperature
Write a solution to find all dates' id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).
Return the result table in any order.

Answer:
SELECT w1.id
From Weather w1
LEFT JOIN Weather w2
ON w2.recordDate = DATE_SUB(w1.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 Day)
WHERE w2.temperature < w1.temperature


Learning notes with ChatGPT:
"If I join on any condition (not necessarily an id), SQL will pull in the matching row(s) from the other table for every row where the condition evaluates to TRUE."
✔ It does not matter if the condition uses:
a column
an expression
a function
a calculation
or a combination of these
As long as the condition is TRUE, the row will join.
If multiple rows match the condition, SQL returns multiple joined rows.

For each row in w1, find all rows in w2 where <condition> is TRUE
Combine them into one output row

You are not saying that w2.recordDate is an actual ID.
But… ✔ You are using w2.recordDate as the matching key
So in this specific join, recordDate plays the role of an ID because each date is unique in this table.
