LeetCode question 620. Not Boring Movies
Write a solution to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring".
Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order.

Answer:
SELECT *
FROM Cinema
WHERE id % 2 = 1 AND description != 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC

Notes / Learning using ChatGPT:
Use of the modulo operator (%)

My initial thought: find movies with the description of "boring", then exlude them. But no, this will overcomplicate the query.
You correctly recognized a logical negation — SQL just lets you express it more directly here. 
Because you already have the row in hand. 
You’re filtering the same table, row by row.
It is simpler than:
- building a subquery
- collecting IDs
- excluding them later

Think of it like this:
“If I already know the color of the apple I’m holding,
why put all red apples in a basket just to avoid them?”

***
Use the simplest expression that directly describes the row condition.
Row-level condition → WHERE column != value
Set-level condition → NOT IN / NOT EXISTS

Row-level = “Can I decide this by looking at ONE row?”
Set-level = “Do I need to look at OTHER rows to decide?”

Set-level:
- You must scan a group of rows
- You’re comparing against a collection, not a value

Other questions:
❓ “Do I need CASE / WHEN?”
👉 No.
CASE WHEN is mainly used for conditional output, not filtering rows.
WHERE is the correct tool here.

❓ “Is CASE WHEN only usable in SELECT?”
👉 Mostly yes, though it can also appear in ORDER BY.
But for conditions like this, WHERE is simpler and clearer.
