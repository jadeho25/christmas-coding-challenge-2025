LeetCode question 619. Biggest Single Number
A single number is a number that appeared only once in the MyNumbers table.
Find the largest single number. If there is no single number, report null.

Answer:
SELECT max(num) as num
FROM (SELECT num
FROM MyNumbers
GROUP BY num
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1) AS single_number

Notes: use "MAX()" to show null values
initially used the GROUP BY, ORDER BY DESC to show the top value (as learnt from another LeetCode question), but that wouldn't show NULL.
Also practiced sub-query thought process.
