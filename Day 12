LeetCode question 607. Sales Person
Write a solution to find the names of all the salespersons who did not have any orders related to the company with the name "RED".

Answer:
SELECT name
FROM SalesPerson
WHERE sales_id NOT IN (
    SELECT o.sales_id
    FROM Orders o
    JOIN Company c
    ON o.com_id = c.com_id
    WHERE c.name = 'RED'
);


Notes from ChatGPT:
*** 
Mental trick for “NOT IN / NOT EXISTS”
Whenever a question says:
“Find all X who do NOT have Y”

Think:
First, find everyone who has Y.
Then, pick everyone NOT in that list.
This immediately leads to NOT IN or NOT EXISTS.
***

Previous incorrect attempt: 
SELECT s.name
FROM SalesPerson s
LEFT JOIN Orders o
ON s.sales_id = o.sales_id
LEFT JOIN Company c
ON o.com_id = c.com_id
GROUP BY s.name, s.sales_id
HAVING SUM(c.name = 'RED') = 0;

^looks like MySQL doesn't accept SUN(c.name = 'RED').
other notes for another attempt: You selected s.name but did NOT group by s.name.
Even if sales_id is unique, SQL rules still require every non-aggregated column in the SELECT list to appear in GROUP BY.

HAVING can only use:
- columns that are in GROUP BY, OR
- aggregate functions (like SUM / COUNT)

***
Why people overcomplicate it
Many people immediately think:
“I need to exclude RED orders, so maybe GROUP BY + HAVING SUM…”
“Or use LEFT JOIN and filter IS NULL”

This works too, but it’s more complex and easier to get logical errors (like your earlier attempts).
Using NOT IN or NOT EXISTS is more direct:
“Get all salespeople who are not in the list of RED sellers.”
